     <h3>The Frequency Hopper Sequencer</h1>

  <body>
    Frequency hopping also known as frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)<br>
    is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching the carrier between <br>
    different frequency channels. Switching occurs based on a pseudo-random sequence<br>
    known to the transmitter and the receiver. <br>
    <br>
    Inspired by this method, my project simulates the 'hopping' between frequencies,<br>
    in a way the musical sequencer does. Unfortunatelly, live sampling of a web SDR, <br>
    which receives the sounds I'm interested in, is very hard to achieve.<br>
    The user can sequence their own melodies, with the limited 'tuning'; a representattion<br>
    of bandwith shift. If the live sampling was possible, this would result in a much broader <br>
    range of available sounds. <br>
    <br>
    This project invites the user to forget about the specific frequencies; they become<br>
    invisible and irrelevant. It encourages whoever decides to play along to tune in to the <br>
    new musical emergence by ear and use their creativity to turn a meaningless radio noise<br> 
    into their own sonic event.<br>
